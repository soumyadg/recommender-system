## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1. Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The Recommender Systems project is an open-source implementation of various recommendation algorithms to provide personalized suggestions to users. Recommender systems are widely used in online platforms, such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, social networks, etc., to help users discover relevant items based on their preferences and behavior.

This project aims to make it easier for developers and researchers to understand, implement, and experiment with different recommender algorithms and evaluate their performance on custom datasets.

### 1.2. Features <a name="features"></a>

- Support for multiple recommender system algorithms:
  - Collaborative Filtering
  - Content-Based Filtering
  - Matrix Factorization
  - Hybrid Approaches combining multiple algorithms
  - Roberta-Based Recommender
- Easy-to-use API for training and making recommendations
- Detailed documentation and examples for quick start

### 1.3. How Recommender Systems Work <a name="how-recommender-systems-work"></a>

Recommender systems work by analyzing historical user-item interactions and generating predictions on what items a user might be interested in. There are several approaches for building recommender systems, including Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Matrix Factorization, and Roberta-Based Recommender. The project explores these methods and offers an evaluation of their effectiveness.

## 2. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
