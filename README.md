# GitHub Project Documentation: Recommender Systems

## Project Overview

This GitHub project focuses on building a recommender system using two different approaches: Cosine Similarity and Roberta. The goal of the project is to generate relevant recommendations for movies in the Netflix dataset based on user input or a selected movie. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create a corpus and then employs the selected methods to find recommendations.

## 1. Introduction

Recommender systems are widely used in various industries to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. In this project, we explore two different approaches to build a recommender system for Netflix movies. The first approach uses the traditional method of cosine similarity, while the second approach leverages the power of Roberta, a state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP model.

## 2. Dataset Information

The data used in this project is collected from the 'Netflix' dataset, available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various movies on Netflix, including titles, cast, descriptions, listed genres, and directors. You can access the dataset through the following link: [Netflix Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anasmahmood000/netflix-movies-dataset).

## 3. Data Import

The first step in the project is to import the Netflix dataset into the system. The dataset contains valuable information that will be utilized to build the recommender system.

## 4. Generating the Corpus

The corpus used for this project is a concatenated version of the movie's title, cast, description, listed genres, and director's information. By combining these textual features, we create a comprehensive representation of each movie, which is crucial for both the Cosine Similarity and Roberta approaches.

## 5. Using TF-IDF

After generating the corpus, we apply the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique to convert the textual data into numerical vectors. TF-IDF assigns a weight to each word in the corpus, capturing its importance in the context of the entire dataset.

## 6. Cosine Similarity Approach

In the first approach, we utilize the cosine similarity metric to calculate the similarity between the user-selected movie or input and all the movies in the dataset. The movies with the highest cosine similarity scores are then recommended as they are considered most similar to the user's input.

## 7. Roberta Approach

The second approach employs the powerful Roberta model, a transformer-based NLP architecture known for its exceptional performance in various NLP tasks. We fine-tune the pre-trained Roberta model on our Netflix movie corpus and use it to generate movie recommendations based on user input.

## 8. Conclusion

Upon comparing the results of both approaches, it becomes evident that Roberta outperforms the cosine similarity method. The reasons for this improvement lie in the advanced capabilities of the Roberta model, which can capture complex semantic relationships, contextual information, and latent patterns in the data. Consequently, Roberta provides more accurate and relevant movie recommendations compared to the cosine similarity approach.

## 9. How to Use the Code

The project's GitHub repository contains the code necessary to run the recommender system using both the cosine similarity and Roberta approaches. Detailed instructions on how to execute the code and generate movie recommendations are provided in the repository's README file.
